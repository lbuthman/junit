- For test coverage, Cobertura can be used to measure how much of the code is executed during tests.

- Find installation instructions here if needed.

- It's always easier to write easily testable code than it is to refactor existing code to make it easily testable.

- You must test all public methods of an API and to stay backwards-compatible "never change the signature of a public
method".

- If a class depends on other classes that need to be instantiated and setup with some state, tests will become
complicated. This is the idea of reducing dependencies and one way to do so is to pass an interface of the object to
a factory/constructor.

- For better test coverage, we add more test cases and in each do the following:
  1) instantiate the test class
  2) set the class into a particular state
  3) assert the final state of the class
  
TEST - CODE - REFACTOR (repeat)
