- The @Before and @After annotations are executed before/after the execution of each one of the @Test methods. This helps
extract common logic, like instantiating domain objects, into known states. This method must be public.

- @BeforeClass and @AfterClass are executed once before/after all the @Test methods in the class. These must be public
and static.

- Adding test under the same package as production classes is good because then you have access to protected and package-
private items.

- Objects are designed to work with other objects, which leads to two flavors of testing: Domain objects being tested
 and Test objects needed to interact with the domain objects.
 
 - Test classes can either live as public classes inside the package or as inner-classes within a test case class. If they
 are simple and likely to stay that way, the inner class verion is preferred.
 
 - A good trick is to initialize common test objects into a @Before initialize() method. This reduces repetition and
 provides commonly needed resources by other methods.
