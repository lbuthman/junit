- Five types of Testing
  1) Unit, 2) Integration, 3) Functional, 4) Stress/Load, 5) Acceptance
  
- Integration testing is about how individual components and classes tie together. These can be written before coding.

- Functional tests examine code at the boundary of its public API; this typically corresponds to testing Use Cases.

- Three types of unit tests
  1) Logical unit tests -> focuses on single a method using mock objects and stubs
  2) Integration unit tests -> focuses on interactions between components in real or part of the real environment
  3) Functional unit tests -> extends the boundaries of integration tests to confirm a stimulus response

- Black box testing has no knowledge of the internal state or behavior of the system, relying soley on external systems
to interface in verifying correctness. All we need to know to test the system are its "functional specifications".

- Three steps to writing a test case
  1) instantiate the class to test
  2) set the class into a particular state
  3) assert the final state of class
