- Five types of Testing
  1) Unit, 2) Integration, 3) Functional, 4) Stress/Load, 5) Acceptance
  
- Integration testing is about how individual components and classes tie together. These can be written before coding.

- Functional tests examine code at the boundary of its public API; this typically corresponds to testing Use Cases.
